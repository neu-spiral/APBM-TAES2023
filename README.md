Data-driven models have great potential to characterize complex systems. However, physics-based models are extremely important as they are able to summarize tons of information from experiments, solid theory, experts, and common sense. Also, physics-based models typically come with easily interpretable parameters that have physical meaning. Why throw that knowledge away when training data-driven models? our proposed augmented physics-based models (APBMs) leverage both worlds. The TAES article trades off both modeling options and presents promising solutions in between, whereby physics-based models are augmented by data-driven components.
